## ToDo

- Add configure wifi on network section.

- Add VNC article.
    - Idea: recommend some resolutions to use for a good UX working.
    - Suggest that any other VNC servers are there.
    - Choose one VNC server.
        - The one suggested by the oficial documentation looks good, because you should start a sesion. For security, looks pretty (at least, to me)
            first connect with SSH, start the service and then connect.

- Aliases
    - Echo temperature.
    - Start VNC server (start VNC service with preconfigured resolution).
