# Raspberry Pi Tools

This repository is not a guide, tutorial or something like this for that, already exists a fantastic [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/), is just a cheat sheet of commands, scripts and tools that I use for playing around with RPI.

Environment: Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS
